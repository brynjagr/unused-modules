# unused-modules

A simple Python script that uses the dependecy graph of webpack to find modules that are not in use. The user is prompted to delete these modules.


## Usage
The script has to be run from the same path as webpack:

`$ python unused-modules.py <frontend path> <comma separated string of extensions>`
